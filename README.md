# MAI Programming Language

MAI is a Python-based programming language designed for simplicity and ease of use. It is intended to be beginner-friendly while still offering powerful features for more advanced users. This markdown file provides an overview of the MAI programming language and its implementation.

## Overview

MAI supports basic arithmetic operations, variable assignment, conditionals, loops, functions, and more. It uses a Python-like syntax to make it familiar to Python developers.

## Code Structure

The MAI programming language is implemented in Python. Below is an outline of the code structure:

- `error`: Defines error classes for lexical and syntax errors.
- `lexer`: Implements the lexer to tokenize the input code.
- `parser`: Parses the tokens generated by the lexer to build an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- `nodes`: Defines various nodes for the AST representing different language constructs.
- `values`: Defines classes for different types of runtime values.
- `context`: Defines the context and symbol table for variable scoping.
- `interpreter`: Implements the interpreter to execute MAI code using the AST.
- `builtins`: Contains built-in functions available in the MAI language.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: The lexer tokenizes the input code into tokens such as identifiers, keywords, operators, and literals.
- **Parsing**: The parser constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the tokens, representing the hierarchical structure of the code.
- **Execution**: The interpreter traverses the AST and executes the code, evaluating expressions and statements.
- **Error Handling**: MAI provides detailed error messages for lexical, syntax, and runtime errors to aid in debugging.
- **Built-in Functions**: It includes a set of built-in functions for common operations like input/output, type checking, list manipulation, etc.

## Example

Here's a simple MAI code snippet:

```python
MAI x = 10
MAI y = 20
MAI z = x + y
print(z)

This code initializes variables x and y, computes their sum, and prints the result.
